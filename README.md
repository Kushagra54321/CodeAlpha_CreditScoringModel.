Credit Scoring Model
This project predicts an individual's creditworthiness using past financial and personal data through Machine Learning Classification Algorithms.

📌 Project Objective
To build a predictive model that classifies whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a term deposit based on their financial history and personal details.

🚀 Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Google Colab
Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
XGBoost Classifier
SMOTE (for balancing)
ROC Curve & Confusion Matrix

📊 Dataset
Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapturovalexander/bank-credit-scoring

Features include:
age, job, marital, education, balance, housing, loan, etc.

⚙️ How It Works
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Feature Scaling using StandardScaler

Handling Imbalanced Data using SMOTE

Model Training with XGBoost Classifier

Model Evaluation with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC

Visualizations: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Feature Importance

🔥 Model Performance
✅ Accuracy: 90%+

📈 ROC-AUC Score: 0.88+

🎯 Sample Prediction Example
The model can predict whether a customer will have good credit score (1) or bad credit score (0) to the service based on inputs like income, debts, etc.
